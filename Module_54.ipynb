    "4. **SMOTENC (SMOTE for Nominal and Continuous Features)**: An extension of SMOTE that can handle both nominal and continuous features in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SMOTETomek**: A combination of SMOTE and Tomek links, where SMOTE is used to up-sample the minority class, and Tomek links are used to remove overlapping instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cluster-based Over-sampling**: Use clustering algorithms to identify clusters in the minority class and then generate synthetic instances within each cluster to up-sample the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Borderline-SMOTE**: A variant of SMOTE that focuses on generating synthetic instances near the decision boundary, where the minority class is most likely to be misclassified.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **ADASYN-Boost**: A combination of ADASYN and boosting algorithms, where ADASYN is used to up-sample the minority class, and boosting is used to improve the classification performance.\n",

    "It's important to experiment with different techniques and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score) to determine which method works best for your specific dataset and project requirements."
